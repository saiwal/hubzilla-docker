# Hubzilla-docker

## Features:

- Use Docker Compose to set up a fully functional [Hubzilla](https://hubzilla.org/page/info/discover) instance with just a few commands.
- Multi-arch prebuilt images available for amd64, arm64, arm/v7.
- Continuous Updates: The Docker image is built to allow for easy updates whenever new changes are made to the Hubzilla core or its dependencies.
- SMTP Integration: Built-in support for sending emails using [ssmtp](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSMTP), making it easy to configure email notifications for your Hubzilla instance.

## Getting started

To get started with the project, simply follow these steps below.

### Deploying with prebuilt image

- Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/saiwal/hubzilla-docker.git
cd hubzilla-docker
```

- Configure Your Environment: Update the `.env` file with your SMTP and database details.
- Run the Container:

```
docker compose up -d
```

### building image

Replace the following

```
image: ghcr.io/saiwal/hubzilla-docker:latest
```

with:

```
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      args:  # Pass build arguments here
        SSMTP_ROOT: ${SSMTP_ROOT}
        SSMTP_MAILHUB: ${SSMTP_MAILHUB}
        SSMTP_AUTHUSER: ${SSMTP_AUTHUSER}
        SSMTP_AUTHPASS: ${SSMTP_AUTHPASS}
        SSMTP_USESTARTTLS: ${SSMTP_USESTARTTLS}
        SSMTP_FROMLINEOVERRIDE: ${SSMTP_FROMLINEOVERRIDE}
        REVALIASES_ROOT: ${REVALIASES_ROOT}
        REVALIASES_WWWDATA: ${REVALIASES_WWWDATA}
      image: hubzilla

```

- Build and Run the Container:

```
docker compose up -d
```

or the following if you need a clean rebuild:

```
docker build --no-cache -t hubzilla -f Dockerfile .
docker compose up -d
```

Access Your Hubzilla Instance: Navigate to https://domain.tld (or the appropriate URL) to view your Hubzilla instance.

## Updating

Simply restart the container and it will pull the latest version of hubzilla from its repository and update addon/theme repositories.

```
docker compose restart
```

## Advanced hub configuration

To edit `.htconfig.php` for configuring advanced hubzilla features connect to container using:

```
docker exec -it <hubzilla_container_name> bash
```

and use `nano` or `vim` to edit `.htconfig.php`

## Why Docker?

Using Docker for Hubzilla provides several advantages:

- Isolation: Each instance runs in its own container, preventing conflicts with other applications.
- Portability: Easily move your setup between different environments (development, staging, production) with minimal effort.
- Consistency: The same environment can be replicated on any machine that supports Docker, ensuring that "it works on my machine" is no longer a valid excuse.

## Tips

- Using `http://` instead of `https://` in siteurl on initial setup will break federation and discovery. Make sure to use SSL and https.
- SMTP environment variables are necessary for admin registration. Make sure they are specified in the `.env` files correctly. Use app passwords if necessary for services with TFA(gmail, etc.).
- Upload size limit is controlled by custom-php.ini, currently set to 20MB. Change if needed to appropriate value.

## Adjusting for use behind a reverse proxy

If you are exposing the containers to the public behind a reverse proxy, some additional steps are needed for logging in the IP addresses of visitors:

1. Access the console of your app container by `docker exec -it <container name> bash`.
2. Enable the `mod_remoteip` module in apache `a2enmod remoteip`.
3. Update the apache configuration, add the following to `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default000.conf` and replace the IP with the IP of the reverse proxy.

```
    <IfModule mod_remoteip.c>
        RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
        # Specify the trusted proxy IPs (replace with your Reverse Proxy IP or network)
        RemoteIPTrustedProxy <REVERSE_PROXY_IP>
    </IfModule>
```

4. Restart apache with `systemctl restart apache2`.
5. Check the logs with `docker compose logs --follow --tail=50`.

## TODO

- [ ] Optimize image size.
- [ ] Option to add custom addon/theme repos.
- [ ] Explore other database systems (Postgres, etc.)
- [ ] Add option to enable apps, account quotas, and other configuration options.
